# Happy Birthday App

Your challenge is to build a web app that will ask the user for a name and birthday.

When the user submits the form, and depending on the current date, the app will either:
- wish the user happy birthday
- tell them how long they'll have to wait until their next birthday

## Views from app:

<img alt="Birthday first page" src="./images/hey.png" width="400px" style="display: block;" space="20" />    
-------
<img alt="Birthday greet" src="./images/you_birthday.png" width="400px" style="display: block;" />    
-------
<img alt="Birthday counter" src="./images/happy_birthday.png" width="400px" style="display: block;" />
