# Happy Birthday App

A web application to find out how many days there are until your birthday.

The user submits their name and birth date onto a form and the app will either:

- tell them how long they'll have to wait until their next birthday

## How to run:

- In the terminal:
```
rackup config.ru
```
- Visit the local port in the browser
- Fill in your name and birthday
